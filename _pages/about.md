I am a PhD student at Institute of Visual Computing (IVC) in Graz University of Technology (TU Graz), supervised by [Prof. Friedrich Fraundorfer](https://ivc.tugraz.at/people/friedrich-fraundorfer/). I received the M.Phil. degree in Computer and Information Engineering from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHKSZ), under the supervision of [Prof. Man-On Pun](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/simonpun/). Before that, I got my B.Eng. degree in Software Engineering at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU). In addition, I had worked at [XGRIDS](https://www.xgrids.cn/) as a research intern and at [Baidu](https://intl.cloud.baidu.com/) as a software development engineer, respectively.

My research focuses on advancing 3D scene reconstruction and understanding, striving to bridge the gap between raw visual data and high-fidelity 3D representations. My current work centers on **Multi-View Stereo (MVS)** and **3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS)**.
